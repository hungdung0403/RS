Recommender systems aim to predict users' interests and recommend product items that quite likely are interesting for them. They are among the most powerful machine learning systems that online retailers implement in order to drive sales.

Data required for recommender systems stems from explicit user ratings after watching a movie or listening to a song, from implicit search engine queries and purchase histories, or from other knowledge about the users/items themselves.

In this report, we use an amazon video game review dataset. Implement methods to recommend videos to users based on content and collaborative filtering. The results are quite high.

- Input: information of video games, user ratings.
- Output: recommended video games for users.
